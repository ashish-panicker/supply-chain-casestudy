# **Case Study: Supply Chain Management System**

## **Objective**  
Develop a microservices-based system to manage the supply chain efficiently, focusing on real-time inventory tracking, order processing, logistics coordination, and customer authentication.

---

## **Selected Microservices**  
We'll implement **four core microservices** to balance complexity and practicality:

### **1️⃣ Order Management Service**  
- Handles purchase orders from customers and suppliers.  
- Tracks order status (Placed, Processed, Shipped, Delivered).  
- Manages order history, cancellations, and modifications.  
- Exposes RESTful APIs for integration with other services.  

### **2️⃣ Inventory Management Service**  
- Manages product stock across multiple warehouses.  
- Updates stock levels based on orders and shipments.  
- Provides APIs for checking real-time stock availability.  
- Implements automatic restocking triggers.  

### **3️⃣ Shipment & Logistics Service**  
- Tracks shipments from warehouses to customers.  
- Optimizes delivery routes based on geolocation data.  
- Manages integration with third-party delivery partners.  
- Sends real-time tracking notifications.  

### **4️⃣ User Service**  
- Manages user registration and authentication.  
- Handles user roles (Customer, Admin).  
- Provides JWT-based authentication and authorization.  
- Stores customer order history and profile information.

## **System Architecture Overview**  
- **Spring Boot** for microservice development  
- **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** for inter-service communication  
- **Kafka / RabbitMQ** for event-driven updates  
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB** for storage  
- **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data  
- **Keycloak / JWT** for authentication and authorization  
- **Eureka / Consul** for service discovery  
- **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway or Kong)** for routing and security
